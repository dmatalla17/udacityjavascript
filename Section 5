Directions:
Declare a function called laugh() that returns "hahahahahahahahahaha!". 
Print the value returned from the laugh() function to the console.

// your code goes here
function laugh() {

Directions:
Write a function called laugh() that takes one parameter, num that represents the number of "ha"s to return.

TIP: You might need a loop to solve this!

Here's an example of the output and how to call the function that you will write:

console.log(laugh(3));
Prints: "hahaha!"


/*
 * Programming Quiz: Laugh it Off 2 (5-2)
 *
 * Write a function called `laugh` with a parameter named `num` that represents the number of "ha"s to return.
 *
 * Note:
 *  - make sure your the final character is an exclamation mark ("!")
 *  - make sure that your function produces the correct results when it is called multiple times

function laugh(num) {
    var ha='';
    for(var i=0;i<num;i=i+1) {
        ha+="ha";

    }
    return string;
}

console.log(laugh(3));

Directions:
For this quiz, you're going to create a function called buildTriangle() that will accept an input (the triangle at its widest width) 
and will return the string representation of a triangle. See the example output below.

buildTriangle(10);
Returns:

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
* * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * *

We've given you one function makeLine() to start with. The function takes in a line length, and builds a line of asterisks 
and returns the line with a newline character.

function makeLine(length) {
  var line = "";
  for (var j = 1; j <= length; j++) {
    line += "* "
  }
  return line + "\n";
}
You will need to call this makeLine() function in buildTriangle().

This will be the most complicated program you've written yet, so take some time thinking through the problem before diving into the code. What tools will you need from your JavaScript tool belt? Professionals plan out their code before writing anything. Think through the steps your code will need to take and write them down in order. Then go through your list and convert each step into actual code. Good luck!


// creates a line of * for a given length
function makeLine(length) {
    var line = "";
    for (var j = 1; j <= length; j++) {
        line += "* ";
    }
    return line + "\n";
}

// your code goes here.  Make sure you call makeLine() in your own code.
function buildTriangle(n){
    var triangle = "";
    for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        triangle += makeLine(i);
    }
    return triangle
}

// test your code by uncommenting the following line
console.log(buildTriangle(100));
